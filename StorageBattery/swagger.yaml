    The storage battery device data model is intended to describe the technical
    characteristics of the battery and the charging and discharging conditions
    of the energy. The charging functionalities apply from a power source which
    can be an 'on-board system, solar panel, wind turbine, generator, power
    supply'. Hydraulic sources are not included in this version. The discharge
    functions apply to all types of system requiring energy consumption from a
    storage battery. : This Data Model can be used directly as a main
    entity to describe the device *Battery Storage* or as a sub - entity of the
    Data Model *DEVICE* using a reference by the *refDevice* attribute.
